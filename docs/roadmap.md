# 🌀 Better Tasks — Roadmap (Updated)

## 🎯 Current Status

Better Tasks is now a **feature-complete, polished v1+ product**.

Recently shipped:
- Saved dashboard views (filters + grouping + search)
- Cross-graph & cross-device persistence (Roam Depot settings)
- Dirty-state awareness with safe Update semantics
- Clean dashboard toolbar layout
- Command palette integration for views
- Seeded dashboard review presets (first install + add-missing command)
- Weekly Review (guided review flow over presets)
- Project grouping mode in the dashboard
- Completed-only “Completed within” date range filter
- Full locale support across dashboard, pills, tooltips, and settings UI

Remaining work focuses on **review workflows, advanced automation, and power-user features** — not core correctness.

## 🌍 Phase 9 — Internationalisation (Completed for UI)

**Completed:**
- Locale-aware Roam Depot settings UI
- Dynamic settings panel refresh on language change
- Locale-aware inline pills and tooltips
- Locale-aware dashboard UI, filters, and presets
- Locale-aware date formatting and first-day-of-week handling

**Explicitly out of scope (for now):**
- Natural-language recurrence parsing across locales

> NLP-based recurrence input is treated as a future AI feature, not an i18n gap.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Selected)

- Task dependencies
- AI-assisted planning and capture
- Optional NLP-based recurrence input (AI-assisted, opt-in)
